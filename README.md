## Challenges and Learnings

### Challenge

Implementing client-side routing using React Router to create a multi-page website template with separate Home, About, and Contact pages.

### Action

Overcame the challenge by taking the following actions:

- **Research and Documentation Utilization:** Invested time in searching and reading documentation resources for React Router to understand its usage and implementation.
- **React Router Integration:** Implemented React Router in the project, setting up routes for each page and configuring navigation links to ensure seamless page transitions.
